 <h1>Basics
============

<h2>Roles</h2>
 <pre>
<p>
There are basically 2 different roles important for you, using this API:

- <strong>Anonymous User:</strong> The credentials for an anonymous user are provided by Upstream Mobility in advance. Your App will stay authenticated using these
  credentials until the user uses their own credentials.
- <strong>Registered User:</strong> A manually registered account, by one of your App's users, based on the user's credentials.

The Anonymous User is considered the least priviledged authenticated consumer of the API. It can consume APIs providing basic information,
like <a href="#operation/search">Locations</a> or <a href="#operation/getOffers">Ticket Offers</a>. For customer-specific resources you need to be authenticated as a
Registered User. The same applies to all Offer-related topics. I.e. if you want to buy a ticket, you need to be authenticated as a Registered User.

More special roles are required for CRM-related APIs ("Customer-Relationship-Management"), i.e. for back office applications:

- <strong>Agent:</strong> An agent can call APIs which deliver information about any registered user. This role is relevant for a back office employee.
- <strong>Admin:</strong> An admin is able to manage agents, e.g. create a new agent account. This role is relevant for a back office manager.

For almost every API endpoint, some form of Authentication is required. Every documented API lists the applicable Security Schemes and Roles.

Whenever you try to access an API endpoint with a not privileged role, a HttpStatus 403 Error Response is returned

<h1>Error Responses
</h1>
<pre>
<p>
If something goes wrong, you will receive a uniform Error Response.

<h2>Error Format

<code>
{
    &quot;httpStatusCode&quot;: 404, //required, contains the HTTP status code
    &quot;server&quot;: { //required, contains information about the specific server that sent the response

        &quot;message&quot;: &quot;The requested resource couldn't be found&quot; //required, human readable description, useful for debugging, NOT to be used for display purposes
    },
    &quot;fields&quot;: [ //optional, a list of field validation errors for POST and PUT requests with a Request Body
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firstName&quot;, //required, the field name of the Request Body
            &quot;error&quot;: { //required, same as above
                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;MISSING&quot;,
                &quot;message&quot;: &quot;field is required, but missing&quot;
            }
        }
    ]
}
</code>

For Legacy reasons, at some API endpoints it is necessary to send a custom <code>Accept</code> Header to receive this error response format. The endpoints in
question mention the possibility of the custom <code>Accept</code> Header explicitly. If the custom <code>Accept</code> Header is not set and something goes wrong, the
response will contain the Legacy error format. Since we don't recommend using the Legacy error format, we won't document it here.

<h1>Date Format
</h1>
<pre>
<p>
Our APIs sometimes expect dates as input in the request body or returns dates in the response body. In this case, we rely on string representation of
the date according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>.

Dates contained in the response body will always be in UTC timezone (zero offset), unless specified otherwise. You may, however, use any other
timezone in requests, as long as the offset is specified correctly.

For better understanding of how the string representation of a date might look like, please take a look
at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME">the Java documentation of ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME</a>
